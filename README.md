# react/redux login

simple react login boilerplate using redux

__Notice:__ This is just an example and needs further customization. The production build is not ready yet (e.g. there is no `/login` route on a production build).
## Usage

```
$ git clone git@github.com:flootr/redux-login
$ cd redux-login && npm install
$ npm run dev
```
